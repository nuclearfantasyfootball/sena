# What is 3rd Round Reversal?

To create a more fair approach to snake drafts, one option available is 3rd
round reversal (3RR).
3RR is a draft setting that follows a typical snake draft, except the 3rd round
is reversed.
Instead of the 1st overall pick getting the 1st pick in the 1st round,
last pick in the 2nd round, and 1st pick in the 3rd round, the order is reversed
so the team chooses last in both the 2nd and 3rd round.

Implementing 3rd Round Reversal (3RR) in leagues makes drafting a little more balanced.
</blockquote>

With the first 3 rounds filled with top-tier players, using 3RR in a league 
draft minimizes the importance of picking early in the draft order.
Since draft order is typically determined randomly, using 3RR in a league draft
allows for a more fair approach to start the season.

# Drafting with 3RR

If 3RR is enabled for a league draft, the result is increased fairness when
considering the average of a team's top picks.
For example, a 12-team league drafts with a snake draft without 3rd round reversal.
Team A would pick 1st overall, and Team B would pick 12th overall.
Consider the draft picks for the first five rounds:

- Team A: Overall Picks 1, 24, 25, 48, 49 (Average of Top 5 Picks: 29.4)
- Team B: Overall Picks 12, 13, 36, 37, 60 (Average of Top 5 Picks: 31.6)

Now consider the same league drafts with 3rd round reversal.
The first five rounds for Team A and Team B would result in the following picks:

- Team A: Overall Picks 1, 24, 36, 37, 60 (Average of Top 5 Picks: 31.6)
- Team B: Overall Picks 12, 13, 25, 48, 49 (Average of Top 5 Picks: 29.4)

At first glance, the average of the picks for the first five rounds is not that
noticeable.
Now consider that without 3RR Team A gets the first pick overall and
has a lower average than Team B that theoretically got the 12th best player.
This results in an advantage for teams that pick earlier in the draft,
with picks for players that are ranked higher by Average Draft Position (ADP).
Teams picking later in the draft are only at a disadvantage, with later picks
and lower ranked players.
