# Dynasty Leagues

Dynasty leagues operate differently than traditional redraft leagues.
In a dynasty league, the players are retained year-over-year on a team's roster.
This means that the dynasty league will not draft a completely new roster each off-season.
Dynasty leagues allow you to get a general manager experience, where you evaluate rookie talent in yearly drafts, as well as determine what aging players to retain on your roster.
In the dynasty format, teams will need to manage their roster considering player age, injuries, new teams, new contracts, and new roles.
Dynasty leagues typically begin with a startup draft and then shift to rookie drafts every off-season.
This creates a dynamic where players are typically moved more via trades and a greater focus is put on the rookie draft in the off-season to acquire new talent.

Startup drafts can vary, commonly setup as a combined draft with rookies and veterans or separated into rookie and veteran drafts.

The key difference in dynasty leagues is that the fantasy football league will operate year-round. There is a larger emphasis on picking up young talent in the off-season via the rookie draft and waivers.
Dynasty drafts also have additional rounds to fill deeper benches and a taxi squad.

# Dynasty Startup Drafts

In dynasty startup drafts there are two common league setups that change how you draft your initial team in a new dynasty league.

<blockquote>
Dynasty startup drafts are typically setup to either draft both rookie and veteran players together, or separate the veterans into a separate draft so that teams can focus on building the foundation of their roster.
</blockquote>

The first common startup draft is setup to keep both veterans and rookies together in a 
single draft. 
This means that teams may select from all players, young and old, creating a free-for-all pool of players that allow teams to go and get their guy.
The second draft setup that is common is to separate the rookie and veteran players into two drafts. 
This allows for teams to create their core roster based on veteran players and then take a shot at the most recent rookie draft class.
Dependent upon how a dynasty draft and league is setup, there are several different strategies that a team can implement dependent on the league's startup draft.
This can depend on the league's standard, half-PPR, or PPR scoring format,
if superflex is enabled, or additional flex spots.

Your strategy is the most important process to follow, keeping consistent throughout the draft. The process can vary depending on scoring or roster positions, but remaining consistent keeps a team's roster building on track.

# What to Expect Each Off-Season

Each league's off-season begins once the commissioner has renewed the league for another season on Sleeper.
A league's off-season begins after the Super Bowl, and gears up around the time of the NFL Draft.
Typically, a league will conduct a rookie draft shortly after the NFL draft finishes, allowing for teams to draft their own rookie prospects to their teams.
This is the common process to promote teams to do their own research on a player and rely less on narratives when training camp begins.
*Note that this is different than traditional fantasy football drafting, as the rookie draft will occur around June or July each off-season, rather than late august like redraft leagues.*
