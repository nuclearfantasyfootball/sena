# League Dues Tracker 

If a league is hosted on the Sleeper platform, then the league dues tracker is an available option allowing commissioners to track who paid their league dues and who did not.
League dues tracker is a list of league members that can be marked off as paid as users trickle in payments for the league entry fees.

<blockquote>
The league dues tracker does not automatically link to LeagueSafe or other league payment applications, so the commissioner must check off each team manually.
If you have recently paid your league dues and have not been marked as paid, check with your comissioner.
