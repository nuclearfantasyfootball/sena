# League ID

A Sleeper league ID can be used to load league data and information.
There are two ways you can obtain a Sleeper league ID.
The first is by navigating to the Sleeper website, and the second is by navigating to general settings in a league in the Sleeper app.

## Website 

On web applications, navigate to the Sleeper website.
Once you login, it will load up a league or navigate to one.
The web address should now have a portion that shows an 18-digit numeric string,
which is your Sleeper league ID.

<blockquote>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-family:'Roboto Mono', monospace;">https://sleeper.com/leagues/</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; background-color:#ffde64; font-family:'Roboto Mono', monospace;">1190192546172342272</span>
</blockquote>

## Mobile App

On the mobile app, go to a league after you log in.
In the top right, there should be a settings button.
Navigate to *General* and at the bottom of general settings should be an option that says *COPY LEAGUE ID*.

<blockquote>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-family:'Roboto Mono', monospace;">COPY LEAGUE ID</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-family:'Roboto Mono', monospace; float:right;">1190192546172342272</span>
</blockquote>
