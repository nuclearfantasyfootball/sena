# Scoring Settings

In a league's scoring settings, there is typically a penalty for fumbles lost.
In Sleeper, this is located in the scoring settings category "Miscellaneous".
Miscellaneous lists points for a fumble and fumble lost.
Fumbles and fumbles lost are applicable to all plays, not just offensive 
plays.

<blockquote>
Miscellaneous scoring setting apply to players for **ANY** type of play and is 
not limited to offense.
</blockquote>

This means that if you start a player in your lineup and they lose a fumble on any play,
including kick and punt returns, they will lose points if the settings list negative points. If a league decides to limit fumbles to just offense on Sleeper, the commissioner will have to manually adjust scores any time this occurs.
