<h1 id="scoring-settings">Scoring Settings</h1>
<p>In a league’s scoring settings, there is typically a penalty for
fumbles lost. In Sleeper, this is located in the scoring settings
category “Miscellaneous”. Miscellaneous lists points for a fumble and
fumble lost. Fumbles and fumbles lost are applicable to all plays, not
just offensive plays.</p>
<blockquote>
Miscellaneous scoring setting apply to players for <strong>ANY</strong>
type of play and is not limited to offense.
</blockquote>
<p>This means that if you start a player in your lineup and they lose a
fumble on any play, including kick and punt returns, they will lose
points if the settings list negative points. If a league decides to
limit fumbles to just offense on Sleeper, the commissioner will have to
manually adjust scores any time this occurs.</p>
