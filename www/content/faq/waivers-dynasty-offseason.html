<p>During the off-season, waivers are still processed for dynasty and
keeper leagues. Redraft leagues reset rosters after the season, so
waivers are not processed until the new season begins. Once a leagueâ€™s
championship has been decided, the league off-season begins once the
league is renewed for the next season. <em>Any moves made after the
championship is decided, if allowed, will not be recorded when a league
is transitioned to the next season.</em></p>
<blockquote>
In dynasty and keeper leagues, year-round player movement is allowed,
beginning with the transition of a league to a new season.

Waivers</h1>
<p>Off-season waivers may vary in frequency depending on the league
settings. Check the league settings to determine when waivers are
processed. This can vary from daily, several times per week, or
weekly.</p>
<p>Typically in NUCLEARFF leagues, waivers in the off-season are
processed once per week. This allows teams to make roster moves without
the need to check daily, as the off-season is not as active as the
regular season.</p>
