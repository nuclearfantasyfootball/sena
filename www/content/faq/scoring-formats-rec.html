<p>Scoring formats for leagues are commonly referred to as standard
scoring leagues, half-PPR leagues, and PPR leagues. PPR stands for
<strong>Points Per Reception</strong> and the aforementioned scoring
formats refer to the amount of points players receive for each
reception.</p>
<blockquote>
League scoring typically discusses standard, half-PPR, and PPR formats.
These 3 formats refer to Points Per Reception (PPR), which indicates
that a reception is worth 0 points (standard), 0.5 points (half-PPR), or
1 point (PPR).
</blockquote>
<h1 id="standard-scoring">Standard Scoring</h1>
<p>Standard scoring formats award players with 0 points per reception.
This league format focuses more on awarding a single point to players
for 10 yards, and keeps scoring considerations to a minimum. Standard
scoring is the traditional format of fantasy football. Standard scoring
leagues primarily involves defense and special teams (DST) as a roster
slot, as well as kickers (K).</p>
<p>Standard scoring formats creates a touchdown-dependent scoring
format, where matchups are typically won by starting lineups with
players who scored the most touchdown. This creates an emphasis on
identifying players with high potential for scoring, which can be
primarily credited to luck or game situation.</p>
<h1 id="half-ppr-scoring">Half-PPR Scoring</h1>
<p>When a league decides to award points for receptions, a whole new
element is introduced into team’s strategies considering who they want
to start on their roster. Half-PPR formats award 0.5 points per
reception, reducing the impact of players scoring touchdown. Half-PPR
does not provide enough of a premium to draft wide receiver (WR) heavy,
but it allows for the consideration of acquiring players that create the
opportunity for receptions. Depending on your league, half-PPR settings
can still lead to drafting with a heavy running back (RB) strategy, but
this is dependent on the picks other teams string together. Opinions may
vary, but the choice of half-PPR over PPR scoring creates a more even
playing field when determining whether to draft an RB or WR.</p>
<p>Half-PPR is a moderate scoring system, where teams can have high
weekly scores, but the values aren’t significantly different than that
of standard scoring formats. In conclusion, half-PPR scoring format
allows for all the excitement of player receptions, but keeps a
relatively fair comparison between RBs and WRs compared to PPR.</p>
<h1 id="ppr-scoring">PPR Scoring</h1>
<p>The final common scoring format is PPR, where players receive a full
point for each reception. PPR, or sometimes referred to as full PPR, is
a different scoring format because it alters the strategy for teams
forming their starting lineups. PPR prioritizes pass-catchers, leading
to an increase in WRs drafted in early rounds and RBs prioritized that
receive 3rd down work with receiving opportunities.</p>
<p>PPR has a greater imbalance compared to half-PPR as WRs can have
games that determine a weekly matchup, and RBs that can rush for a large
amount of yards weekly don’t have the same significance as those who can
finish a game with multiple receptions. The argument for PPR is that it
creates an exciting environment with higher scoring, and forces teams to
strategize more when identifying late round players to draft as they can
make or break a season. The alternative is that PPR reduces the impacts
of quarterbacks (QBs), beyond those in the elite tier. Reducing the
impact of QBs can be good or bad based on opinion and preference when
forming a draft strategy for the different formats.</p>
