<p>Sign-ups for Nuclear Fantasy Football leagues are posted during the
off-season. If a league spot has opened up in an existing league or if
we are planning to open a new league, announcements are posted in all
leagues and social media.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the league chat if you are already in a NuclearFF
league or join the discord for off-season announcements on league
openings, signing-up for new leagues, and the addition of alternative
formats.</p>
<blockquote>
NuclearFF league sign-ups occur in the off-season for open spots and new
leagues. We continue to expand the number of formats and leagues
year-over-year. Check the Discord or your league chat if you are already
in a NuclearFF league for sign-up information.

<h2 id="what-formats-do-you-offer">What Formats Do You Offer?</h2>
<p>NuclearFF leagues include redraft, dynasty, survivor, and chopped
formats for the 2025 season. In 2024, NuclearFF also included a vampire
format. Each season, we continue to evolve by adding additional fantasy
football formats we think others would be interested in. Suggestions for
new leagues or reviving old formats are always welcome by posting in the
Discord.</p>
