<p>When attempting to propose a trade on Sleeper, teams have the option
for the trade to self-destruct after a specified amount of time. Teams
have the option to propose a trade that expires with options
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Hour</li>
<li>End of Today</li>
<li>24 Hours</li>
<li>2 Days</li>
<li>1 Week</li>
<li>2 Weeks</li>
<li>Never</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the trades tab on Sleeper, teams can see a timer with a
countdown until the trade self-destructs. Trades on Sleeper have options
to modify or withdrawal the trade as well. If a team is having second
thoughts or offered the wrong assets in a trade, the withdrawal option
is available. If a team wants to up the offer or possibly think they
offered too much, they can modify the trade. <em>Note that if a trade
modified, the self-destruct countdown restarts.</em></p>
<h1 id="importance-of-exploding-trades">Importance of Exploding
Trades</h1>
<p>Proposing trades with an expiration can be crucial to managing a
team. Setting a timer on a trade proposal is beneficial for a number of
reasons, and allows for assisting teams especially when they have
several leagues and trade proposals.</p>
<blockquote>
Exploding trades can help teams from leaving trades pending for weeks,
protecting rosters from accidentally acquiring injured players, and
getting the best value possible in each trade.
</blockquote>
<p>One benefit of exploding trades is motivating the other party to make
a decision. The countdown to a trade expiration date can push others to
either accept, deny, or counter within the timeframe rather than sitting
on the trade offer for weeks.</p>
<p>Another benefit of exploding trades is protecting your roster. For
example, a team has proposed a trade with no expiration date that has
been pending for weeks. In this case, the team may have proposed trading
for a player with a season ending injury in exchange for their player
with no injury designation. Since the trade offer is still available and
did not expire, the team with the injured player could swoop in and
accept the trade for their own benefit. This examples shows that
expiration dates on trades could protect a roster in the event that an
owner is not keeping continuous tabs of what trade offers are still
open.</p>
<p>The final benefit to discuss about exploding trades is the constant
fluctuation of player value in the regular season and off-season. For
example, a team could be willing to trade a player that is a backup, but
in the timeframe the trade offer has been open, the player could have
earned the starting spot. In this example the player now likely holds
much more value and could potentially be utilized in a starting roster
slot or traded for more. This leaves teams in a vulnerable position
where they either need to constantly monitor the status of players on
their roster or use self-destructing trades for assistance.</p>
