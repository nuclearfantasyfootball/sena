<h1 id="free-agents">Free Agents</h1>
<p>Typically in fantasy football leagues, players are added from the
waiver wire.</p>
<blockquote>
Players acquired through free agency must remain on a roster for at
least 24 hours before being dropped to waivers. Teams can still drop the
player within the 24-hour period, however, the player will return
directly to free agency instead of moving to waivers.
</blockquote>
<p>The 24-hour rule is implemented on Sleeper by default. The rule is
put in place to prevent teams from adding and dropping several players
prior to a game, resulting in those players being unavailable to the
league.</p>
<h2 id="example-of-the-24-hour-rule">Example of the 24-Hour Rule</h2>
<p>For example, if a team adds a player via free agency on Sunday
morning prior to kickoff, the team must keep the player on their roster
for at least 24 hours prior to dropping the player to waivers.</p>
<p>If a team adds a player on Sunday at 10:00 AM ET, and then drops that
player at 11:00 AM ET on the same day, the player will return to free
agency instead of moving to waivers.</p>
<p>If a team added a player <em>from waivers</em> on Sunday at 10:00 AM
ET, and then drops that player at 11:00 AM ET on the same day, the
player will move to back to the waiver wire.</p>
