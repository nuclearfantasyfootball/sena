<p>Taxi squads are available in dynasty fantasy football leagues that
allow teams to stash extra players that are either rookies or early in
their career. Taxi squad players do not count against the active roster
limit.</p>
<blockquote>
Taxi squads provide teams with additional roster flexibility to develop
young players.
</blockquote>
<h1 id="taxi-squad-slots">Taxi Squad Slots</h1>
<p>Taxi squads are limited to a certain amount of players defined by the
league commissioner. The league commissioner can allow anywhere from 0
to 10 players on a taxi squad, depending on the league. To add a player
to a slot in a team’s taxi squad, the team must first add the player as
a free agent or waiver wire pickup first to the starting lineup or
bench. Teams can then move the player to the taxi squad, freeing up a
roster spot. There is no current capabilities to add a player directly
to the taxi squad. Taxi slots are eligible to rookies and players
between 1-4 years of experience, depending on the league settings.</p>
<h1 id="forming-a-taxi-squad">Forming a Taxi Squad</h1>
<p>A team may assemble a taxi squad by adding eligible players to taxi
slots if the player’s experience is less than the taxi squad duration
defined in the league settings. Taxi squad players can only be moved to
an open slot once the player is on a team’s starting lineup or bench.
Non-rookies are allowed on taxi depending on a league’s settings.</p>
<h2 id="years-of-eligibility">Years of Eligibility</h2>
<p>Taxi slots and eligibility are defined in the league settings as taxi
squad duration. The taxi squad duration is the amount of years of
experience a player has. For example, if the taxi squad duration is set
to 2 years, this means that players with 0, 1, or 2 years of experience
are eligible to be placed on the taxi squad. The year of experience is
determined at the end of each NFL season.</p>
<blockquote>
Players are eligible for taxi based on league settings for taxi squad
duration. This is the number of years of experience a player has,
updated at the end of each NFL season.
</blockquote>
<h2 id="taxi-squad-deadline">Taxi Squad Deadline</h2>
<p>Taxi squads have a deadline for when players can be moved to the taxi
squad prior to the taxi squad slots being locked. Typically, a taxi
squad deadline is set to the start of the NFL regular season, requiring
all players to be moved to open slots prior to the start of Week 1.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-move-players-in-and-out-of-a-taxi-squad">Can I Move
Players In and Out of a Taxi Squad?</h2>
<p>Players can be moved in and out of taxi squads with a few notes.
Teams can move taxi squad players to the starting lineup or bench at any
time.</p>
<blockquote>
Teams can <strong>always</strong> move players from the taxi squad to
the starting lineup or bench. Teams have a deadline for moving players
into taxi slots.
</blockquote>
<p>Teams can <strong>only</strong> move players into taxi slots prior to
the taxi squad deadline. Once the taxi squad deadline has passed,
players can no longer be moved to taxi slots.</p>
