Allowed (PA)</h1>
<p>Points For (PF) is the amount of points scored by a team in your
league. PF is calculated weekly from the starting lineup of a team.
Points Allowed (PA) is the amount of points scored against a team in
your league. PA is the amount of points scored from the starting lineup
of the opposing team in your league matchup.</p>
<blockquote>
PF and PA are cumulative stats, where the sum PF and PA that each team
has over the season is shown in the standings. PF is a tiebreaker in the
standings, so if 2 teams finished the season with the same record, the
team with the most PF will be seeded 1st in the playoffs.

<h1 id="max-points-for-max-pf">Max Points For (Max PF)</h1>
<p>Max Points For (Max PF) is the maximum potential points or most
points that a team could have scored. Max PF is calculated considering a
team’s starting lineup, and bench. The value for Max PF is the amount of
points a team could have achieved in the best possible scenario when
that team started every player on their roster with the highest amount
of points for that week in the starting lineup.</p>
<h2 id="does-taxi-squad-count-towards-max-pf">Does Taxi Squad Count
Towards Max PF</h2>
<p>If your league is a dynasty league, taxi squad also counts for Max PF
by default on Sleeper. Some dynasty leagues do not count taxi squads as
part of the max PF, as that is the development portion of a team’s
roster. Typically this happens in dynasty leagues that set rookie draft
order by lowest max PF, where the lowest value is the 1st draft pick
overall. This allows for dynasty leagues to be setup to reward the worst
scoring teams with the highest draft picks and not just rely on the
standings where teams could get a lucky win and lost the 1st pick
overall. To not account for taxi squad scoring as part of the max PF,
the league commissioner will typically calculate Max PF on their own and
then announce the draft order.</p>
