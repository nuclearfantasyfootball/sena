<p>To create a more fair approach to snake drafts, one option available
is 3rd round reversal (3RR). 3RR is a draft setting that follows a
typical snake draft, except the 3rd round is reversed. Instead of the
1st overall pick getting the 1st pick in the 1st round, last pick in the
2nd round, and 1st pick in the 3rd round, the order is reversed so the
team chooses last in both the 2nd and 3rd round.</p>
<blockquote>
Implementing 3rd Round Reversal (3RR) in leagues makes drafting a little
more balanced.
</blockquote>
<p>With the first 3 rounds filled with top-tier players, using 3RR in a
league draft minimizes the importance of picking early in the draft
order. Since draft order is typically determined randomly, using 3RR in
a league draft allows for a more fair approach to start the season.</p>
<h1 id="drafting-with-3rr">Drafting with 3RR</h1>
<p>If 3RR is enabled for a league draft, the result is increased
fairness when considering the average of a team’s top picks. For
example, a 12-team league drafts with a snake draft without 3rd round
reversal. Team A would pick 1st overall, and Team B would pick 12th
overall. Consider the draft picks for the first five rounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team A: Overall Picks 1, 24, 25, 48, 49 (Average of Top 5 Picks:
29.4)</li>
<li>Team B: Overall Picks 12, 13, 36, 37, 60 (Average of Top 5 Picks:
31.6)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now consider the same league drafts with 3rd round reversal. The
first five rounds for Team A and Team B would result in the following
picks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team A: Overall Picks 1, 24, 36, 37, 60 (Average of Top 5 Picks:
31.6)</li>
<li>Team B: Overall Picks 12, 13, 25, 48, 49 (Average of Top 5 Picks:
29.4)</li>
</ul>
<p>At first glance, the average of the picks for the first five rounds
is not that noticeable. Now consider that without 3RR Team A gets the
first pick overall and has a lower average than Team B that
theoretically got the 12th best player. This results in an advantage for
teams that pick earlier in the draft, with picks for players that are
ranked higher by Average Draft Position (ADP). Teams picking later in
the draft are only at a disadvantage, with later picks and lower ranked
players.</p>
