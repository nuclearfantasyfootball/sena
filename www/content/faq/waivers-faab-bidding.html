Budget (FAAB)</h1>
<p>FAAB or Free Agent Acquisition Budget is an alternative to
traditional waivers. FAAB provides teams with a season long budget
(e.g., $100) to acquire free agents through a blind bidding process.
Rather than relying on the waiver process where order determines which
team has priority to acquire a player, FAAB allows all teams to have an
opportunity to add players through a blind bidding process. Each week
waivers will process on day(s) and time(s) that are defined in the
league settings. When waivers process, team managers win the player with
the highest FAAB bid.</p>

<p>Sleeper leagues default budget is set to $100 FAAB for redraft
leagues. Some leagues may have different budgets (e.g., $1000), such as
the default for Chopped leagues, or in the case that FAAB is defined by
the league commissioner. Minimum bid amounts can be defined as well, but
are set as $0 FAAB by default. The FAAB amounts do not roll over
automatically from season-to-season and it should never reset.</p>
<h1 id="managing-multiple-bids">Managing Multiple Bids</h1>
<p>In the case of a team setting multiple waiver claims, waiver
priorities are set by the bid amount. For example, a manager has a
roster spot available and would like to acquire a RB. The manager can
bid on multiple players, which are prioritized by the bid amount. In
this case, the manager would acquire the RB they placed the highest FAAB
bid value on if all other league teams were outbid. If the team did not
win the RB they assigned with the highest bid/priority, they can still
win other RBs if they have a higher FAAB bid than other teams.</p>
<p>If a team bids the same FAAB amount on multiple players, the waiver
priority can be adjusted on the Sleeper app under <strong>Team &gt;
Transactions</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="faab-bid-tiebreaker">FAAB Bid Tiebreaker</h1>
<p>If two or more teams bid the same amount, the tiebreaker is
determined by waiver wire priority, acting as rolling waivers. Waiver
wire priority is listed in the league standings next to each team.</p>
<p>The waiver priority starts based on the draft order. For dynasty
leagues, it is based on your most recent draft order. This results in
teams that had the 1st overall pick receiving the lowest waiver
priority. Teams with the last pick would be given first priority on
waivers. When a player is successfully claimed through waivers, the
teamâ€™s waiver priority will be moved to the end of the queue and all
other teams are moved up. Note that free agent acquisitions are not the
same as waivers, and acquiring a player through free agency will not
affect the priority order.</p>
<h1 id="invalid-waiver-claims">Invalid Waiver Claims</h1>
<p>In some instances, you may see teams that had entered a higher bid
but lost the claim. These teams will have <strong>(Invalid)</strong>
listed next to them. Invalid waiver claims can be due to a number of
reasons, such as not enough FAAB, or not enough roster space due to
already acquiring another player. Invalid claims can also occur when a
team attempts to drop a player paired with the FAAB bid, but the player
was already dropped from a previous acquisition from a winning FAAB bid.
Teams could still have an open roster spot to add the player, however,
the bid would be unsuccessful because the dropped player defined in the
bid is required to be a part of it.</p>
