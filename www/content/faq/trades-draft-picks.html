<p>Trading draft picks can be important for a team to acquire the
necessary picks they desire to go and get their guys or acquire more
draft capital. Draft pick trading is permitted across all league
formats, including redraft, keeper, dynasty, and chopped leagues.</p>
<blockquote>
Draft pick trading is allowed for all leagues types. This includes
redraft, keeper, dynasty, and chopped leagues.
</blockquote>
<p><em>Note that for a redraft league, draft pick trading is only
allowed prior to the draft starting.</em> If the option for draft pick
trading does not appear to be available, request the commissioner to
enable the setting “Allow Draft Pick Trading” in a Sleeper league’s
settings. To keep track of draft pick trades, refer to the Sleeper
draftboard, which reflects all picks that were traded. The draftboard
visually displays which team the draft pick was traded to.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that teams are allowed to draft over the roster limits
in leagues where players are retained season-to-season like dynasty and
keeper leagues. This means that if you have more picks than available
slots on your roster, this can be addressed after the draft when a team
has made all their picks. During the draft, all rosters are locked,
meaning that teams cannot add or drop players.</p>
<h1 id="trading-during-live-drafts">Trading During Live Drafts</h1>
<p>Draft pick trading is allowed during live drafts, except for redraft
leagues. Each time a draft pick is traded, the league’s draftboard will
update to show the newly acquired picks for teams.</p>
<h2 id="trading-for-the-pick-on-the-clock">Trading for the Pick on the
Clock</h2>
<p>If a team trades for the draft pick that is currently on the clock,
the pick timer <strong>WILL NOT RESET</strong>. For example, assume a
team trades for pick 1.5 in a draft that has a 5 minute pick timer. If
there is 2 minutes and 30 seconds remaining on the clock when they
acquire the pick, they will only have 2 minutes and 30 seconds to make
that pick.</p>
