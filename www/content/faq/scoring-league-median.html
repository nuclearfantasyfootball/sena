<h1 id="extra-game-against-league-median">Extra Game Against League
Median</h1>
<p>An additional setting that can enabled in fantasy football leagues is
extra game against league median, where each week teams have an
additional matchup against the league median score. This means that in
addition to a regular weekly matchup against another team, teams also
have a matchup against the median score of all teams in the league.
Enabling the option of an extra game each week against the league median
applies to the regular season only.</p>
<h1 id="impact-on-standings">Impact on Standings</h1>
<p>Enabling an extra game each week against league median awards top
performing teams with an additional win, while the teams scoring less
than the median receive a loss. The purpose of implementing this setting
is to reward high-scoring teams for the weekly performance, even if the
team lost in a tough head-to-head matchup.</p>
<blockquote>
Extra game against league median helps create a more fair option for
teams when they finish in the top half in weekly scoring, but still lost
the head-to-head matchup.
</blockquote>
<p>Adding a league median minimizes the impact of luck in head-to-head
matchups. Luck is still a factor in fantasy football, and enabling this
setting does not eliminate luck, but it does create a more balanced
approach to the league standings based on how they perform.</p>
<h1 id="calculate-league-median">Calculate League Median</h1>
<p>The league median is calculated by considering weekly scores of all
teams in a league, and taking the average of the two teams in the middle
of the scoring distribution. For example, in a 10-team league, the
median is calculated by averaging the 5th and 6th highest scores of the
week. If the 5th highest score for the week is 120 points and the 6th
highest score is 115 points, the league median takes the average of
these two scores.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{League Median} = \frac{120 + 115}{2} = 117.5
\]</span></p>
<p>In this example, the league median score for the week is 117.5
points. Teams that score above 117.5 points would win an extra matchup
for the week, and teams that score below would lose, creating the
possibility of a team going 2-0 in a week, 1-1, or 0-2.</p>
<h2 id="possibility-of-a-tie">Possibility of a Tie</h2>
<p>In the event that a team scores exactly the same as the league
median, a tie is issued for the week. This is an extremely rare
occurrence, but it is possible.</p>
