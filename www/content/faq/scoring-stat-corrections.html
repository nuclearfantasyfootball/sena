<p>If you are trying to determine why a player’s stats changed it likely
means that you are in a very tight weekly matchup. Regardless,
orrections to game statistics for a player can be changed throughout the
week on Sleeper. Sleeper can add corrections up to and including
Thursdays, although the platform notes that most corrections happen on
Monday and Tuesday. Stat corrections happen, and although not common,
can impact the result of a team’s weekly matchup. If using Sleeper, the
weekly report does not imply that a matchup is final, and corrections
can occur after the report is posted.</p>
<blockquote>
Sleeper can make stat corrections up to including Thursdays, although
most occur on Monday and Tuesday. In addition, a weekly NFL stat
correction list is published, although these may not be the only
corrections needed in Sleeper.
</blockquote>
<p>Each week an <a

stat correction list</a> is published. Official stat corrections are
released weekly by the NFL League Office and the official statistician
of the NFL, Elias Sports Bureau. Sleeper stat corrections could match
the NFL public stat correction list, but they are not always the same.
Sleeper obtains data from a separate data provider that may have their
own errors. In this case, Sleeper and their provider will make
corrections to match NFL stats.</p>

league settings and select “Stat Corrections” to view any weekly
adjustments.</em></p>
