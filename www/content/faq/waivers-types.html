<p>The waiver wire, or waivers, is where unclaimed players are put on a
temporary hold before teams have an opportunity to add them to a their
roster via a claim. Depending on the format, when waivers are processed,
the team with the highest waiver priority will be awarded the player.
The league commissioner defines the waiver format or type in the league
settings. Waiver types include rolling waivers, reverse standings, and
FAAB bidding.</p>
<blockquote>
There are three main types of waiver wire formats: rolling waivers,
reverse standings, and FAAB bidding. Each format has its own advantages
and disadvantages.
</blockquote>
<p>The waiver wire will work differently depending on a league’s
settings defined by the commissioner. The three different types of
waivers are described below.</p>
<h2 id="rolling-waivers">Rolling Waivers</h2>
<p>Rolling waivers is the default format on the Sleeper platform. When a
league uses rolling waivers, the waiver priority is continuous, based on
the last team to waiver a player being moved to the end of the queue.
For every waiver claim that is successful, the team is moved to the end
of the queue that adds the player off waivers, and the remaining teams
are moved up.</p>
<blockquote>
Rolling waivers is a continuous waiver format where the team that last
successfully claimed a player is moved to the end of the queue.
</blockquote

## Reverse Standings

Rather than continuous waivers, reverse standings waivers reset each week
based on the standings. 
The teams with the worst records have the highest priority (e.g., The team in
last place has the highest priority).
The reverse standings waiver format allows for prioritizing teams that need 
roster development to improve their team.

<blockquote>
Reverse standings waivers prioritize teams with the worst records to
help improve their roster.
</blockquote>
<h2 id="faab-bidding">FAAB Bidding</h2>
<p>FAAB, or Free Agent Acquisition Budget, is an alternative to
traditional waivers. Each team is provided with a budget (e.g., $100) to
acquire players through waivers using a blind bidding process.</p>
<blockquote>
FAAB bidding allows teams to acquire players through waivers using a
blind bidding process. This gives everyone an opportunity to acquire the
players they prefer, rather than relying on waiver priority.
</blockquote>
<p>When waivers are processed, the team with the highest bid is awarded
the player. Bids can be defined by the commissioner with a required
minimum bid, which is set to $0 by default.</p>
