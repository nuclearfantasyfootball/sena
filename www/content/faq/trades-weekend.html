Implications for Weekend Trades</h1>
<p>There is a possibility that teams in a league will agree to a trade
right before NFL games are scheduled to kickoff. The trade will process
depending on the league setting, “Time to Review Pending Trades”, which
can be anywhere from no time at all, up to 3 days. One a trade is
processed, this can create a unique situation on gamedays or
weekends.</p>
<blockquote>
If a trade is processed on gamedays or weekends, there is a unique
situation where one party in the trade could use their newly acquired
players and the other party cannot. Players cannot be used in the event
that their game has already started.
</blockquote>
<p>Processed trades will allow for any player <em>who has not yet
played</em> to become available for the new team to utilize immediately.
If a player has <em>already played that week</em>, then the player is
locked into the original team’s roster with the designation, “Off
Roster”. This means that the team acquiring a player who has played or
their game has already started will not be able to use them or acquire
any points they earned that week.</p>
