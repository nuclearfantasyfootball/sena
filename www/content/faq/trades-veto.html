<p>Trades within a league are allowed for teams to ideally both benefit
from swapping players or draft picks. Typically, teams may have opinions
on the fairness of the trade and have the option to approve or deny the
trade via league majority vote. This is also known as a <em>trade
veto</em>, and if enabled in league settings, a poll to approve or deny
the trade is automatically populated in the league chat on Sleeper.
Although a trade can be vetoed with majority votes from other teams, it
is ultimately up to the commissioner. The commissioner can approve or
deny the trade prior to the poll expiring.</p>
<h1 id="trade-vetoes">Trade Vetoes</h1>
<p>Trade value for players are opinionated, and at times others may view
a team clearly won a trade and gained an advantage. Regardless if a team
won or lost a trade, the trade should be approved as both teams accepted
the terms hoping to improve their roster or draft capital. By allowing
the trade veto polling process, this allows for possible influence of
each teamâ€™s opinion on the trade and could result in a team getting cold
feet from others opinions.</p>
<blockquote>
In leagues coordinated by Nuclear Fantasy Football, trade vetoes are
disabled. Opinions from other teams in a league are dogmatic, and it is
ultimately up to the parties involved to determine if they wanted to
move forward when they accepted the trade.

<p>There is one case where a trade can be vetoed. If the trade is viewed
as collusion and so lopsided that it does not appear both owners
realistically viewed it as a benefit, then it is up to the league
commissioner to make the decision on a trade veto.</p>
