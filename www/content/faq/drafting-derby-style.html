<p>Typically, a leagueâ€™s draft order is determined randomly, leaving it
up to chance on whether a team will pick early or late in the draft.
Random draft orders are standard for fantasy football leagues, however,
it restricts teams from drafting in a range they are more comfortable
with in their draft approach. A solution to eliminating some of the luck
and promoting strategy in league drafts is by implementing a derby style
draft order.</p>
<h1 id="derby-style">Derby Style</h1>
<p>Implementing a derby style draft order in a league requires an
additional step where teams will pick their draft slot based on the
random draft order that was previously generated. This extra step allows
teams to pick their draft slot and gives more control to those teams in
choosing their destiny. This allows for additional strategy in how teams
want to approach the draft and where they want to pick.</p>

<p>If derby style is implemented, consider that a random draft order was
generated for the league. Team A has the 1st overall pick, Team B has
the 2nd overall pick, and Team C has the 12th overall pick. In this
case, Team A would be able to pick any draft slot from 1st pick to 12th
pick. Assuming Team A picks the 3rd overall pick, Team B now is able to
choose any draft position except for the 3rd slot occupied by Team A.
Team C will pick 12th overall, ultimately leaving the draft slot to luck
and what the other teams in the league did not choose.</p>
