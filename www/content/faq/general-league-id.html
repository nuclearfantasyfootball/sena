<p>A Sleeper league ID can be used to load league data and information.
There are two ways you can obtain a Sleeper league ID. The first is by
navigating to the Sleeper website, and the second is by navigating to
general settings in a league in the Sleeper app.</p>
<h2 id="website">Website</h2>
<p>On web applications, navigate to the Sleeper website. Once you login,
it will load up a league or navigate to one. The web address should now
have a portion that shows an 18-digit numeric string, which is your
Sleeper league ID.</p>

there should be a settings button. Navigate to <em>General</em> and at
the bottom of general settings should be an option that says <em>COPY
