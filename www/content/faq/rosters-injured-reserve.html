<p>Injured Reserve (IR) are additional slots on team rosters
specifically for players that are unable to play. Depending on the IR
settings the league commissioner has set, teams may have the option to
place players on IR, if injured reserve slots is not set to zero.</p>
<blockquote>
Players eligible for IR by default include those with the player status
designation <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">PUP</span> or
<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">IR</span>.
</blockquote>
<p>Additional options for IR eligibility include players who will not
play for a designated week (OUT), players who are doubtful or unlikely
to play (DOUB), suspended players (SUS), players who did not report or
are on holdout (DNR), and players with COVID-19.</p>
<h1 id="injury-status-designation">Injury Status Designation</h1>
<p>A player’s injury tag can change multiple times throughout the week
in the regular season. If a player is ruled out for a specific week, the
injury status designation applies to that week only. This means that a
player ruled out will not retain the out status beyond that specific
week, reset on Wednesdays.</p>
<blockquote>
Players cannot retain the <span
style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">OUT</span> status unless they have
been officially ruled out for their next game.
</blockquote>
<p>An overview of player injury designations are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PROBABLE</strong>: Player is likely to play</li>
<li><strong>QUESTIONABLE</strong>: Player has a 50/50 shot to play,
could have limited reps</li>
<li><strong>DOUBTFUL</strong>: Player is not likely to play</li>
<li><strong>OUT</strong>: Player will not play for designated week</li>
<li><strong>SUSPENDED</strong>: Player is suspended and will not
play</li>
<li><strong>IR</strong>: Player has been placed on injured reserve and
will not play (minimum 4 weeks)</li>
<li><strong>PUP</strong>: Player has been placed on Physically Unable to
Perform (PUP) list and will not play (minimum 4 weeks)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bye-weeks">Bye Weeks</h2>
<p>Bye weeks operate differently for a player’s injury status. On a
player’s bye week, they will retain their injury status from the
previous week. For example, if a player on a roster is ruled out in Week
13, and the player’s team is on bye in Week 14, they will keep the out
status for both weeks. This also applies to players designated with
suspended, questionable, doubtful, and COVID-19.</p>
<h2 id="locked-rosters">Locked Rosters</h2>
<p>If a player is no longer eligible for IR, a team must create roster
space to move the player back to the bench or starting lineup. Teams
cannot make any additional roster edits, add players from free agency,
or add players from the waiver wire until this is resolved.</p>
<p>If a team does not have roster space and prefers to not drop a
player, the additional option is to explore trading a player from the
roster to create space.</p>
