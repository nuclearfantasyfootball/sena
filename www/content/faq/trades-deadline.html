<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>The trade deadline is the final period of the fantasy football
regular season where teams can make trades for draft picks, FAAB, or
players. Trade deadlines are set to prevent teams from making trades
that could unfairly benefit competing teams in the playoffs. The
deadline is set to prevent collusion and prevent situations where teams
that will not make the playoffs from trading away key players for lesser
value. League trade deadlines can vary by league based on the
commissioner settings.</p>
<h1 id="sleeper-trade-deadlines">Sleeper Trade Deadlines</h1>
<p>The trade deadline set in a Sleeper league allows teams to accept
trades up until the end of the specified week. Trades can be accepted
until the final game of the week has ended. If a league has a set time
to review pending trades, the trade can be processed after the
deadline.</p>
<blockquote>
The trade deadline occurs in leagues at the conclusion of the final game
for the specified NFL week.
</blockquote>
<p>Sleeper fantasy football trade deadlines are set by the league
commissioner. By default, Sleeper trade deadlines are set to Week 11 of
the NFL season. Some leagues may vary to allow additional time for
trading, such as the Week 12 deadline set for the NUCLEARFF REDRAFT
league. It is common that most leagues are set to Week 11, allowing
enough time to configure your roster before the start of fantasy
playoffs that typically begin in Week 14 or 15.</p>
<h1 id="trade-deadline-example">Trade Deadline Example</h1>
<p>For example, if a league has defined a trade deadline of Week 11 on
Sleeper, this means that all trades must be accepted before the final
game Week 11 ends. Trades can no longer be accepted once the final game
of Week 11 has ended on Monday night. In this case, this means that you
can propose and accept trades up until the end of Week 11. In 2024, the
Week 11 trade deadline was Monday, November 18th at the conclusion of
the matchup between the Houston Texans and Dallas Cowboys. Week 11 trade
deadlines in 2025 occur at the end of the Dallas Cowboys and Las Vegas
Raiders matchup on Monday, November 17th.</p>
<h1 id="when-is-trading-allowed-again">When is Trading Allowed
Again?</h1>
<p>Redraft leagues do not allow trading after the deadline, and trading
will be enabled again when the next season is renewed prior to the
fantasy draft.</p>
<p>Dynasty and keeper leagues differ, as these formats allow trading as
soon as the league has been renewed for the new season after the
playoffs have concluded.</p>
