<p>If a league is hosted on the Sleeper platform, then the league dues
tracker is an available option allowing commissioners to track who paid
their league dues and who did not. League dues tracker is a list of
league members that can be marked off as paid as users trickle in
payments for the league entry fees.</p>
<blockquote>
The league dues tracker does not automatically link to LeagueSafe or
other league payment applications, so the commissioner must check off
each team manually. If you have recently paid your league dues and have
not been marked as paid, check with your comissioner.
