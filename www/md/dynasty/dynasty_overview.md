Dynasty leagues are the fantasy football version of being a general manager (GM) for an NFL team.
In dynasty, teams carry their roster over from season-to-season.
Dynasty is a long-term format where team managers will have to consider more than just the performance of a player for a single season.
Managing your dynasty team is more complex than other formats, as you must compose a roster of players considering age, future destination if a contract year is near, and the incoming class of NFL rookies year-over-year.
Dynasty managers will initially draft a team in a startup draft, followed by a rookie draft before the beginning of each season.
Players and future draft picks can be traded, where managers can elevate their team to chase a championship or sell a team for a rebuild.
Smart decisions and costly mistakes are amplified in this league format, compounding over time to shape the leagueâ€™s balance - building super teams or forging lasting dynasties.
Your decisions can be advantageous if you choose wisely, or punish you for seasons to come when a costly mistake is made.
