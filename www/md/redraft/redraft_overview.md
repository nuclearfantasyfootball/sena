Redraft leagues are the traditional fantasy football format and most simple.
Each year a league is typically filled with 10 to 12 teams, where team owners start with a clean slate and get the opportunity to draft the players of their choice.
Each fantasy team starts with draft picks heading into the current season’s draft, which are allowed to be traded or used to acquire players for the current season’s roster.
This league format is a short-term commitment in fantasy football.
Redraft does not consider future picks and is structured for team owners to only consider the current season.

Redraft leagues can vary in several ways, including scoring, rosters, and number of teams.
Depending on your league settings, this can alter your drafting strategy greatly.
For example, leagues with different scoring could vary points per reception (PPR). 
Leagues that award 0.5 points per reception (half-PPR) may focus on drafting elite running backs early in the draft.
Other redraft leagues could include additional starting spots, such as including multiple flex spots (WR/RB/TE or WRT).
This would change your draft strategy such that you focus on the position that is sparse in elite players and take shots on other positional players later in the draft.
An example of this would be focusing on top-tier WRs early in the draft and taking several RBs late that could be boom or bust.
A final factor to your strategy in redraft leagues is the number of teams.
Typically leagues have 10 to 12 teams, but leagues can include 14, 16, or even 32 teams.
Leagues with more teams typically increase the difficulty when drafting as you have less opportunity to draft high-end players to win your league. 
Team managers will have to dig deep to find that diamond in the rough, which may be deep on the depth chart.

In addition to redraft leagues, there are alternative formats that still require managers to draft new rosters each season with a twist.
Chopped leagues focus on points scored across the entire league instead of head-to-head matchups.
Vampire leagues allow all team managers to draft except for one selected at random that must pick their entire roster off the waiver wire.
Joker leagues award a bonus to QBs who make a tackle during a game with a significant bonus that wins your matchup.
