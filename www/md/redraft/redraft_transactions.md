### What is FAAB and How Does It Work?

FAAB or Free Agent Acquisition Budget is an alternative to traditional waivers.
FAAB provides teams with a season long budget (e.g., $100) to acquire free agents through a blind bidding process.
Rather than relying on the waiver process where order determines which team has priority to acquire a player, FAAB allows all teams to have an opportunity to add players through a blind bidding process.
Each week waivers will process on day(s) and time(s) that are defined in the league settings.
When waivers process, team managers win the player with the highest FAAB bid.

### Managing Multiple Bids 

Sleeper leagues default budget is set to $100 FAAB. 
Some leagues may have different budgets (e.g., $1000) that are defined by the league commissioner.
Minimum bid amounts can be defined as well, but are set as $0 FAAB by default.
The FAAB amounts do not roll over automatically from season to season and it will never reset.

In the case of a team setting multiple waiver claims, waiver priorities are set by the bid amount.
For example, a manager has a roster spot available and would like to acquire a RB.
The manager can bid on multiple players, which are prioritized by the bid amount.
In this case, the manager would acquire the RB they placed the highest FAAB bid value on if all other league teams were outbid.
If the team was did not win the RB they assigned with the highest priority, they can still win other RBs if they have a higher FAAB bid than other teams.

Examples: 
Team 1 bid $20 on Bijan Robinson and $10 on Chuba Hubbard. 

Team 2 outbid Team 1 with a $21 bid on Bijan Robinson and won.
Team 1 was the highest bidder on Chuba Hubbard, and as the second highest priority, they are able to acquire the RB.

OR


Team 1 was the highest bidder on Bijan Robinson and has 1 available roster spot.
Team 1 will acquire the RB, and the $10 Chuba Hubbard bid is voided.

OR

In the case of bidding the same FAAB amount on 2 RBs, the user can set the priority in Sleeper under Team > Transactions.

### Tiebreaker

If two or more teams bid the same amount, the tiebreaker is determined by waiver wire priority, acting as rolling waivers.
Waiver wire priority is listed in the league standings next to each team.

The waiver priority starts based on the draft order. 
For dynasty leagues, it is based on your most recent draft order. 
This results in teams that had the 1st overall pick receiving the lowest waiver priority.
Teams with the last pick would be given first priority on waivers.
When a player is successfully claimed through waivers, the teamâ€™s waiver priority will be moved to the end of the queue and all other teams are moved up.
Note that free agent acquisitions are not the same as waivers, and acquiring a player through free agency will not affect the priority order.

### Invalid Waiver Claims

In some instances, you may see teams that had entered a higher bid but lost the claim. These teams will have "(Invalid)" listed next to them. 
Invalid waiver claims can be due to a number of reasons, such as not enough FAAB, or not enough roster space due to already acquiring another player.
Invalid claims can also occur when a team attempts to drop a player paired with the FAAB bid, but the player was already dropped from a previous acquisition from a winning FAAB bid.
Teams could still have an open roster spot to add the player, however, the bid would be unsuccessful because the dropped player defined in the bid is required to be a part of it.
