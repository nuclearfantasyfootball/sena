Survivor is a very simple format that allows managers to pick a team each week during the NFL season that they think will win their matchup.
Managers who correctly pick a winning team will survive and advance to the next week.
If a manager incorrectly picks a team that loses, they will be eliminated from the competition pool.
Week-over-week this process occurs until the last team manager is remaining, crowned the champion of survivor.

Survivor has a strategy of its own, as NFL teams are considered rather than individual players.
The twist to survivor is that you can only pick an NFL team one time each season.
This means that you have to plan accordingly, as the longer you survive, the more limited you are on your options of which team will win that week.
For example, if you choose the Baltimore Ravens to win in Week 1, you will not be allowed to choose them in any future matchups.
Note that in the event of a game finishing in a tie, you will be eliminated regardless of the team you chose.
