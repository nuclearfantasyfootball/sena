Chopped or guillotine are a variation of redraft leagues, where the focus is on teams competing against the entire league rather than head-to-head matchups.
The format is the same for both chopped and guillotine, where the name changes depending on what platform you are using (Sleeper refers to their leagues as Chopped).
There is only one goal in this league format, do not finish the week with the lowest amount of points scored.

Every week the team with the lowest amount of points scored is eliminated or chopped from the league.
All other teams are safe and have another shot at trying to survive the next week.
When a team is eliminated, the entire roster is released to the waiver wire.
The result is a waiver wire full of new players, allows the remaining teams to bid on the players and potentially improve their team.
This process of elimination continues every week until only one team remains, crowned as the league champion.

Chopped leagues require short-term planning, drafting well, and making impactful waiver wire bids.
 as there is a budget on the total amount you can spend on players for the season.

Chopped leagues in-season strategy revolves around the waiver wire and bidding on players to add to your roster if you survive.
The amount of money you can spend on players for the season is your Free Agent Acquisition Budget, or FAAB.
FAAB budget is a key in chopped leagues, where team managers must determine whether they want to break the bank for a player and spend it all or divvy it up for several players.
In addition, a team must consider whether to spend their FAAB early in the season, or potentially use it later when more teams and players are eliminated.

Typically chopped leagues are setup to award 1 point per reception (PPR), and include 18 teams for the league to last the entire NFL regular season.
FAAB budgets are set to $1000, which is for the entire season if you survive. By default, Sleeper chopped leagues do not allow trades.
